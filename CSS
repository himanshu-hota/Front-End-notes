CSS:-
    1. CSS units:-
               a.) % = when we want to set dimensions relative to the parent.
               b.) vh vw = when we want to set dimensions relative to the visible area of the screen.
               c.) em = Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font
               d.) rem = Relative to font-size of the root element
               
               Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
                    * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.

    2. Positioning:-
                a.) static:- by default.
                b.) relative:- The element is positioned relative to its normal position. //left right top bottom
                c.) absolute:- absolute is positioned respect to the first relative positioned parent,No space is reserved for the element by default.
                d.) fixed:- positioned fixed to the viewport,when we scroll the element stays at its location. for example social bars on websites.
                e.) sticky:- it is combination of relative and fixed,for example scrolling background images in websites.
